# neovim
my nvim lua setup

uhh...
I somehow messed it up

You can find the configs in the branch "master" 

to implement this config 

If you already have neovim then you'd have this .config directory in your home navigate there 

move all the file to this path ~/.config/nvim/  

Make sure you have installed packer.nvim in your system if not,

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim 

 this will do the job 

 open nvim and run PackerSync command 

 to get the dashboard you should go to

 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/alpha-nvim/lua/alpha/themes/dashboard.lua 

 and change the ASCII header as you wish
